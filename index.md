### About Me

Originally from the foothills of the Cascades in Washington State, I completed my undergraduate degree nearby at Western Washington University, in math/biology. 

Immediately upon graduating I began a job on the Bering Sea as a field biologist. I spent 3 years traveling and working on research projects in the field, but have consistently found myself gravitating towards the statistical and data analysis aspects of these roles. I've always loved math and analytics and it's super exciting to me to dive into a dataset and see what I can learn!

Naturally, I sought out an office position where I could analyze spatial data and solve problems related to resource use. I started programming in earnest there and couldn't get enough! Here I am a few years later about to finish my masters degree in statistics.

Moving forward I aim to integrate my prior expertise in science with my skills in data analysis and modeling to explore other areas of application. I'm constantly impressed by how much valuable data is in a business setting and I want to be a part of that.


### What I'm working on right now: 

* Tying up any loose ends before I graduate!
* Finishing my master's project where I'm using [random forests to classify local climate zones in large urban areas.](https://github.com/erickabsmith/masters-project-lcz-classification) 
* Teaching statistical concepts and R labs to undergraduate and graduate students. 


### Some of my past projects:

* [Group Project Work on the American Statistical Association Section on Statistics and the Environment ENVR Data Challenge 2020.](https://jimmylovestea.shinyapps.io/datadash/) - **We won Honorable Mention (2nd Place) nationwide!**
* [Analysis of Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) Resource and Conservation Engineering Division (RACE) Eastern Bering Sea Continental Shelf Survey Data.](https://github.com/erickabsmith/flatfish_2020)
* [A comparison of negative binomial, quasi-Poisson, and Poisson regression of COVID-19 cases.](https://github.com/erickabsmith/generalized_regression_models)
* [A project using parallel processing, Amazon EC2, and bootstrapping to estimate the probability of completing the Pacific Crest Trail](https://github.com/ST541-Fall2020/erickabsmith-project-trail)
* [An interactive shiny app for visualizing species distribution data](https://erickabsmith.shinyapps.io/catch-data/)

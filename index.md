### What I'm working on right now: 

* Looking for a data science position
* Finishing my master's project where I'm using [random forests to classify local climate zones in large urban areas.](https://github.com/erickabsmith/masters-project-lcz-classification) 
* Teaching statistical concepts and R labs to undergraduate and graduate students. 

### Some of my past projects:

* [Group Project Work on the American Statistical Association Section on Statistics and the Environment ENVR Data Challenge 2020. ](https://jimmylovestea.shinyapps.io/datadash/) - **We won Honorable Mention (2nd Place) nationwide!** Note: This link is SLOW due to the extremely high volume of data
* [Analysis of Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) Resource and Conservation Engineering Division (RACE) Eastern Bering Sea Continental Shelf Survey Data.](https://github.com/erickabsmith/flatfish_2020)
* [A comparison of negative binomial, quasi-Poisson, and Poisson regression of COVID-19 cases.](https://github.com/erickabsmith/generalized_regression_models)
* [A project using parallel processing, Amazon EC2, and bootstrapping to estimate the probability of completing the Pacific Crest Trail](https://github.com/ST541-Fall2020/erickabsmith-project-trail)
* [An interactive shiny app for visualizing species distribution data.](https://erickabsmith.shinyapps.io/catch-data/) (Note: This link is also a little slow due to the size of the data)

### A little about me:

Originally from the foothills of the Cascades in Washington State, I completed my undergraduate degree nearby at Western Washington University, in math/biology. Between my undergraduate and graduate programs I traveled and worked as a field biologist. It was enjoyable, and I learned a lot about how data is collected and how statistical analysis results are used, but I was truly missing the computational analyses I got to do as an undergraduate student! I love digging around in data and seeing what I can learn.

While applying for graduate school I began my transition back to the world of data working for a GIS firm that analyzes spatial data. Then I started in the statistics master's program at OSU the following Fall. It's been incredible to be back to coding and modeling and using my skills to answer find patterns in data and answer questions. I can't wait to get back into industry.

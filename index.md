### About Me

I'm originally from the foothills of the Cascades in Washington State. I completed my undergraduate degree in Math/Biology nearby at Western Washington University. Immediately upon graduating I began working on the Bering Sea as a field biologist. I spent quite a few years traveling and working as a biologist, but have consistently found myself gravitating towards the statistical and data analysis aspects of these roles. This led to a position where I worked as a GIS technician analyzing spatial data and solving problems related to resource use. I determined it was time for me to return to school and pursue my more computational interests. 

### What I'm working on right now: 

* Tying up any loose ends before I graduate this March 2021!
* My master's project where I'm using random forests to classify local climate zones in large urban areas. 
* Teaching statistical concepts and R labs to undergraduate and graduate students.

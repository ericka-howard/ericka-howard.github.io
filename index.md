## Welcome!

My name is Ericka and here's a taste of my background and experience working with data. **For more info you can check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erickabsmith/), or just reach out at <smith.ericka.b@gmail.com>**

### What I'm working on right now: 

* Looking for data science opportunities
* Finishing my master's project: Local Climate Zone Classification in Mega Urban Areas using Satellite Imagery and Random Forests. [[GitHub]](https://github.com/erickabsmith/masters-project-lcz-classification) 
* Teaching statistical concepts and R labs to undergraduate and graduate students. 

### Some of my past projects:

* Interactive and Explorative Web-Based Tool for Communication of Large Ensemble Models and Climate Reanalysis Datasets. **We won 2nd Place (Honorable Mention) in this nationwide American Statistical Association contest!** [[shinyapps.io]](https://jimmylovestea.shinyapps.io/datadash/) (Note: This link is SLOW due to the high volume of data.)
* Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization of Scientific Survey Data. [[GitHub]](https://github.com/erickabsmith/flatfish_2020)
* A comparison of negative binomial, quasi-Poisson, and Poisson regression of COVID-19 cases. [[GitHub]](https://github.com/erickabsmith/generalized_regression_models)
* Bootstrapping the Pacific Crest Trail in Parallel. [[GitHub]](https://github.com/ST541-Fall2020/erickabsmith-project-trail)
* An interactive shiny app for visualizing species distribution data. [[shinyapps.io]](https://erickabsmith.shinyapps.io/catch-data/) (Note: This link is also a little slow due to the size of the data)

### A little about my story:

Originally from the foothills of the Cascades in Washington State, I completed my undergraduate degree nearby at Western Washington University in math/biology. Between my undergraduate and graduate programs I traveled and worked as a field biologist. It was enjoyable, and I learned a lot about how data is collected and how statistical analysis results are used, but I was truly missing the computational analyses I got to do as an undergraduate student! I love digging around in data and seeing what I can learn.

While applying for graduate school I began my transition back to the world of data working for a GIS firm that analyzes spatial data. Then I started in the statistics master's program at OSU the following Fall. It's been incredible to be back to coding and modeling and using my skills to answer find patterns in data and answer questions. Looking forward to a return into industry! Please don't hesitate to contact me to connect.

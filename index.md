## Welcome to my Github Landing Page!

My name is Ericka Smith and I'm a master's student in the Statistics Department at Oregon State University. I'm originally from the foothills of the Cascades in Washington state, and I completed my undergraduate degree at Western Washington University in Math/Biology. I spent quite a few years working in natural resources, culminating in a position where I worked as a GIS technician with spatial data, using remote sensing to identify water and land use change.

### What I'm working on right now: 

* Tying up any loose ends before I graduate this March 2021!
* My master's project where I'm using random forests to classify local climate zones in large urban areas. 
* Teaching statistical concepts and R labs to undergraduate and graduate students.
